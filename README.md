If you get the error message "Something went wrong. Reload", you can do the following steps:
====
* Open "https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/"
* Paste the link to your notebook, (e.g. "https://github.com/chiustin/NTHU_Application-of-Data-Science-and-Deep-Machine-Learning-in-Chemical-Engineering/blob/master/Python/Code/10_function.ipynb") there and then you get "https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/chiustin/NTHU_Application-of-Data-Science-and-Deep-Machine-Learning-in-Chemical-Engineering/blob/master/Python/Code/10_function.ipynb"
